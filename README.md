# Hi, I'm Chad!

Cybersecurity professional with 5+ years in IT and 1+ year in security—currently focused on **cloud incident response**, threat detection, and automation. <br/>
By day, I audit environments and build detection logic. By night, I experiment in my homelab: automating AWS incident response, deploying honeypots, and now threat modeling how LLMs might leak PII under pressure.

## 🧠 What You'll Find Here

Projects where I bridge hands-on skills with real-world security practice:

☁️ **Cloud Security** – AWS & Azure hardening (GDPR, NIST & CIS controls)  
🛡️ **Threat Detection & SIEM** – SOC labs, alert tuning, honeypots  
🔬 **Defensive R&D** – Malware analysis, automation, packet captures  
🧠 **AI/LLM Security** – Prompt injection, STRIDE modeling, data leakage testing in enterprise chatbots
